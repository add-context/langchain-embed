# langchain-sidecar

This is an empty repository that will hold a UI starterkit for building [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs) apps that be embedded on any website, similar to how [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com) can be embedded. 

Application side-loading on a webapge is a fairly nuanced undertaking. The goal of this project is to:

1. Provide code, examples, and guides on how to build side-loadable web apps. 
2. Experiment, and establish best practices and principles for building these types of apps.
